[Greek Gods Galore Live Page](https://darrachbarneveld.github.io/Project-1-Code-Institute/)

Greek Gods Galore is an informative online resource that delves into the mythologies surrounding the 12 Greek gods who resided atop Mount Olympus. The site provides detailed accounts of each deity's characteristics, symbols, and legends, allowing readers to gain a deeper understanding of the ancient pantheon. This is a mock site and as such features a mailing list that is not currently active. The site was built by myself, an enthusiast of classical civilisation and mythic lore. It is a passion project as well as a project for the Code Institute's assessment.

## Design

### Design Choices

To design this website, I conducted research on other websites that provide information about the 12 Greek gods. I explored different layouts, font styles, and color schemes to determine what would best appeal to our target audience. Ultimately I chose a simple single page layout to enhance navigation and a sticky header. This proved the most responsively friendly design.

Some websites visited for reference are:

1. [Theoi](https://www.theoi.com/)
2. [Greek Mythology](https://www.greekmythology.com/)
3. [Greek Gods and Goddesses](https://greekgodsandgoddesses.net/)

### Colours

Using other websites as a reference as well as the inspiration of ancient statues, ruins and artefacts I went for a nude colour scheme. [Venngage's Accessible color palette generator](https://venngage.com/tools/accessible-color-palette-generator).

Primary Colours - #f2e9cc / #ffffff / #dac6b7

Secondary Colours - #1c1c1c / #fffaf0

All colours were checker using [Accessible Webs Contrast Checker](https://accessibleweb.com/color-contrast-checker/). This ensured the page was compliant to WCAG AAA standards.

![Colour scheme](documentation/colour-scheme.webp)

### Fonts

All fonts used were sourced and imported from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) library.

The main text font used was Lato with a sans-serif fallback. The lightweight Lato was a design choice to offset the bolder titles. All headings and sub-headings were initially designed with Castoro Titling but was later switched to Quattrocento as it featured a bold style.

### Structure

The structure of the page follows a basic an easy to follow flow. The design choice to remain on a single page meant the user could follow a journey as they scrolled through the page. The content was split into 5 distinct sections.

1. Header/Navigation
2. Hero Section
3. Introduction Section
4. Gods Section
5. Subscribe & More Info Section.
6. Footer

There was also two futher supplementary sections to provide a more well rounded experience. A 404 page was designed to route all traffic that visited a broken link back to the homepage and a success section for when the user filled out the subscription form.

#### Header Section

1. Text Logo featured on the left of the header.
2. Navigation items to the left hand side.
3. Sticky header that allows the users to easily navigate the website even when scrolling.

#### Hero Section

1. Large background image with engaging and descriptive title.
2. Animated image of a renaissance painting of the 12 Greek Gods.

#### Introduction / History Section

1. Paragraph describing the Gods.
2. Informative embedded video sourced from [The Life Guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri-AoKE42rw).
3. Paragraph on Mount Olympus.
4. Embedded Google Maps showing Mount Olympus on the map.

#### Gods Section

1. Cards with images of the 12 Greek Olypmic Gods.
2. Cards link to each section of the page that describes them in more detail.
3. Description of the gods.

#### Subscription Section

1. Form for subscribing to the mailing list.
2. Mock Articles showcasing the content received via subscription.

#### Footer Section

1. Greek Gods Galore Logo
2. Social Icons
3. Email contact of the website founder/creator.

| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Due to the hero image animation using CSS background url the image was unable to be optimised. This lead to high load times and poor performance.             | Using CSS media queries the hero image was disabled on mobile devices leading to better performance and lighthouse scores.                                                                             |
| Embedding youtube videos and lead to large delays in performance. Reduce unused JavaScript, Javascript execution times and serving static assest were issues. | Following the tutorial on [Vumbnail](https://vumbnail.com/examples/srcdoc-iframe-for-lighthouse) I was able to drastically reduce performance issues by following the instructional srcdoc html setup. |
| Embedding Google Maps meant the certain errors were not able to be resolved. These were serving static assests with an efficient cashe policy.                | Unfortunately no reasonable solution was found and this is a common error when embedding google maps. Without use of custom Javascript code which is beyond the scope of this project.                 |
