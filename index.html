              The twelve Greek gods were believed to have lived on Mount
              Olympus, which is the highest mountain in Greece. According to
              Greek mythology, Zeus, the king of the gods, resided on the peak
              of the mountain, while the other gods lived on different parts of
              the mountain.
            </p>
            <p class="section-text">
              The top of Mount Olympus was thought to be the most sacred place
              in Greece and was only accessible to the gods and certain mortals
              who were deemed worthy of visiting. The Greeks built many temples
              and shrines on the slopes of the mountain to honor the gods, and
              the site remains an important cultural and religious landmark in
              Greece today.

              Hera was the queen of the gods in ancient Greek mythology, and the
              wife and sister of Zeus. She was often associated with marriage,
              childbirth, and family, and was regarded as the protectress of
              women and children. Hera was also a powerful and vindictive
              figure, prone to jealousy and revenge, particularly towards her
              husband's many lovers and illegitimate offspring. Despite her
              complicated relationship with Zeus, Hera was widely worshipped
              throughout ancient Greece, particularly by married women seeking
              fertility and protection. Her cult played an important role in
              shaping ancient Greek attitudes towards gender roles, family, and
              marriage.

              Hermes was the Greek god of commerce, communication, and travel.
              He was often depicted as a youthful and mischievous figure,
              associated with wit, cunning, and invention. Hermes was also the
              messenger of the gods, responsible for delivering their messages
              and guiding souls to the underworld. His cult was particularly
              popular among merchants, travelers, and thieves, and his festivals
              were marked by feasting, gambling, and revelry. Hermes was also
              associated with boundaries and transitions, as he was believed to
              be able to move freely between different realms and worlds. His
              myths and legends continue to inspire artists, writers, and
              entrepreneurs to this day.

              Poseidon was the Greek god of the sea, earthquakes, and horses. He
              was often depicted as a powerful and bearded figure, holding a
              trident and riding a chariot pulled by sea creatures. Poseidon was
              widely worshipped throughout ancient Greece, particularly by
              sailors and fishermen seeking protection and safe voyages. His
              cult also played an important role in shaping ancient Greek
              beliefs about the power and unpredictability of nature, as well as
              the fragility of human civilization in the face of natural
              disasters. Poseidon was also associated with fertility and
              abundance, as the sea was believed to be a source of sustenance
              and prosperity for coastal communities.

              regarded as the patron of kings and rulers. Despite his many
              extramarital affairs and questionable behavior, Zeus was widely
              worshipped throughout ancient Greece, particularly as a symbol of
              power and order. His cult played an important role in shaping
              ancient Greek beliefs about authority, hierarchy, and the

                  There are many gods in Greek mythology that possess power,
                  strength, and status. Ares is the Greek god of war, and Hades
                  was the Greek god of the underworld. So who was the strongest
                  Greek god, and why was he considered the strongest?
